# Nand-To-Tetris

Nand-To-Tetris Hack Assembler, compiles HACK assembly language code to machine binary for the HACK computer.

Built using resources from the Nand-To-Tetris course but wasn't built using the recommended modules, and as such is very hacky and clunky. This doesn't display the recommended software architecture for the assembler in any shape or form, and I wouldn't recommend using my assembler over anyone elses.
